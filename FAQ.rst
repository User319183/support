
F.A.Q.
========
I've prepared a nice short little list of many common questions and answers. If you have a question that isn't answered here, feel free to ping me (@User319183#3149) in our staff-chat


**Q1: A member's ticket has been resolved. Should I leave the ticket opened?**


**A1: Unless you have something to tell staff about a message or about a ticket ban, save the ticket to the transcript & close the ticket.**



**Q2: A member opened a ticket and asked for supported executors. What do I do?**


**A2: Type "?executors" in the ticket and reply to the question. This command will show a list of executors the script will work on.**



**Q3: Multiple people are facing the same (or similar) issues with the script. What should I do?**

**A3: Test the script and see if you can replicate the problem, if you're not able to replicate it, keep assisting them as they might be having an issue. If it is a problem you're also facing, ping Vynixu in staff chat and let him know the issue and executor used. Also, let the person in the ticket kknow that the owner has been notified.**



**Q4: Someone opened a ticket because they purchased beta. What do I do?**


**A4: Ask them if they purchased beta using Robux or Paypal. If they purchased it using Robux, ask them for the purchase screne & their Roblox username. If they purchased it using Paypal, ask them for their paypal username & a screenshot of the purchase screen.**



**Q5: Someone opened a ticket and asked for help on an executor/another script?**


**A5: Let the user know that you are not allowed to help with other scripts/executors. You are allowed to suggest sites to them like google or youtube.**

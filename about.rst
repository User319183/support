
What do you do?
========
Being a support member can be a tough role. You have to do testing and be really active and aware of what's going on.

When a member goes to the #support channel and creates a ticket, they rely on you. You have to be there to help them.
You have to be able to answer their questions and help them with their issues. You also have to be able to test their problems and see if you can replicate them.

When a member creates a ticket, it's strongly suggested you too read the #support rules until you are familiar with them.
